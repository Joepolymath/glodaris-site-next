                GLODARIS is an international consulting firm that specializes in
                working with companies to enable them to successfully design and
                implement Lean Manufacturing or the Toyota Production System
                (TPS). We are experienced in engaging with clients at all
                organizational levels. Our broad Lean expertise and ability to
                adapt Lean concepts and methodologies to the needs of each
                specific business is what differentiates us from other
                organizations.

                Our consultants are experienced hands-on Senior Lean
                practitioners with extensive experience assessing and applying
                Lean in diverse business sectors: Healthcare, Finance,
                Education, Government/ Services, Food, Finance and
                Manufacturing. We have a good approach for identifying and
                eliminating waste in operations through continuous improvement
                for doing everything more efficiently, reducing the cost of
                operating the system and fulfilling the customers desire for
                maximum value at the lowest price.

                Lean is a systematic method for the elimination of wastes within
                a process. These include wastes created through unevenness in
                workloads, overburden and any work that does not add value. From
                the point of view of the customer who consumes a service or
                product, “value” is any process or action that a client would be
                willing to pay for. In essence, lean is focus on making obvious
                what appends value by decreasing everything else.

            Our model for Lean Transformation is different than most other lean
            consulting firms. Our value add is in the coaching and training we
            provide to facilitate culture change while developing our clients'
            internal competencies. We are not interested in providing armies of
            consultants to lead improvements and thus make our clients fully
            dependent on us. Instead, we build our clients' capability by
            creating daily management and daily kaizen systems that will
            self-sustain. This approach fits in with principle 1 of the Toyota
            Way: "Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even
            at the expense of short-term financial goals.” While our competitors
            may end up with more revenue from an engagement than we might in the
            short term, our clients are happier and gladly recommend us again
            and again.
